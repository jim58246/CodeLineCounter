Code Line Counter
=================

The target of this project is to make a simple code line counter for python source code.

I found most of metrics tools are not easy for startup, and some projects aimed at count python source code lines have no GUI. There algorithm are not accurate as well, e.g. they take line starts with # as comments, which may not true. 

I will not improve the algorithm currently but I reserve the possibility for that.

I use OOP and tkinter for this project, currently no extra package required.
